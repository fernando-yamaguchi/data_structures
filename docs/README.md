# Data Structures in C

This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures in C. It is designed as an educational resource to assist with learning about data structures and algorithms, as well as to strengthen C programming skills. It can be used as a toolkit for implementing
data structures and algorithms in C.

## Implemented Data Structures

- **Linked List**: A sequence of nodes where each node stores its own data and a reference to the next node in the sequence.
- **Stack**: A collection of elements that supports two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element.
- **Queue**: A collection of elements that supports adding elements from one end and removing them from the other.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

### Status

- Linked List - Preview
- Stack - In progress
- Queue - In progress
- Binary Search Tree - In progress
